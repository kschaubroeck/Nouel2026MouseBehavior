\title{Estimate Marginal Means}
\usage{
emms(
  .results,
  .covariates,
  ...,
  .scale = c("response", "link"),
  .weights = c("proportional", "cell", "equal"),
  .level = 0.95,
  .seed = 1234,
  .vcov = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.results}{A named list of fitted model objects.}

\item{.covariates}{A tidyselect specification of covariate columns to compute
means over.}

\item{...}{Must be empty. Exists to force named arguments.}

\item{.scale}{Scale for reporting results. Either "response" (default) for
the original response scale, or "link" for the link function scale.}

\item{.weights}{Method for weighting cells. One of "proportional" (default),
"cell", or "equal".}

\item{.level}{Confidence level for intervals (default: 0.95).}

\item{.seed}{Random seed for reproducibility (default: 1234).}

\item{.vcov}{Optional variance-covariance specification created by \code{robust()}.
If NULL, uses model's default vcov.}
}
\value{
A named list with the same names as \code{.results}, where each element is
a tibble containing unadjusted means, adjusted means, and confidence intervals,
or NULL if estimation failed.
}
\description{
Compute estimated marginal means (EMMs) from fitted model results, including
both unadjusted means and adjusted means with confidence intervals.
